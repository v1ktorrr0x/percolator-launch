-- Waitlist schema — run this on the waitlist Supabase project
-- (project ref: pqivhfxyyswivraymlfu)
--
-- This file is idempotent. Run it on a fresh project to bootstrap, or
-- on the live project to apply pending changes — both reach the same
-- end state.
--
-- Design:
-- - Anonymous users insert via the publishable key (RLS allows insert only).
-- - Server-side route /api/waitlist/signup verifies the wallet signature
--   BEFORE inserting, so RLS-allowed inserts are gated on real ownership.
-- - SELECT is denied to anon (privacy: don't leak the email-list-equivalent).
-- - Counter + position lookups + referral-code presence checks are exposed
--   via SECURITY DEFINER functions callable by anon.
--
-- Inputs we accept: wallet-only (pubkey + signature + message), email-only,
-- or both (Privy email login → embedded wallet → signed message). At least
-- one of pubkey or email must be present.

-- always succeed. Idempotent: re-runs are no-ops because the WHERE clause
-- already excludes already-normalised rows.

-- ─── Operator-only: referral leaderboard ────────────────────────────────────
-- WHO USES THIS: only the operator, via the service-role key (server-side
--   or `psql` with the project's database URL). Never callable by anon or
--   authenticated users — anon is the role the publishable key maps to,
--   and exposing the full pubkey/email columns would defeat the privacy
--   posture of the rest of the schema (no anon SELECT on rows).
--
-- HOW TO QUERY:
--   • Supabase SQL editor (logged in as project owner):
--       select * from public.waitlist_referral_leaderboard();
--   • psql with the DB URL:
--       psql "$WAITLIST_DB_URL" -c \
--         'select * from public.waitlist_referral_leaderboard() limit 50;'
--   • Server-side from Node:
--       supabase.rpc("waitlist_referral_leaderboard")
--     where `supabase` was constructed with WAITLIST_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
--     (see app/lib/waitlist/supabase.ts → getWaitlistServiceSupabase).
--
-- WHY IT'S TAMPER-RESISTANT:
--   • referred_by_code is set at INSERT time by the signup route. The route
--     never UPDATEs it afterwards.
--   • The RLS policy on the waitlist table grants anon INSERT only — no
--     UPDATE or DELETE policy exists, so anon cannot mutate the column.
--   • This function reads `count(*)` of rows that reference each code; an
--     attacker would need INSERT access to a row with a chosen
--     referred_by_code (which they have — but their inserted row is then
--     subject to the same RLS, and the route validates `referred_by_code`
--     points at a real code before accepting). They cannot decrement, edit
--     ownership of, or hide existing referrals.
--   • Service role bypasses RLS but the service-role key lives in operator
--     env (Vercel project + local .env), not in the browser bundle.
