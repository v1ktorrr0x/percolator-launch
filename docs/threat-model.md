# Percolator Threat Model — 2026-03-31

**Maintained by:** Security agent (Sentinel)  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-31 00:05 UTC  
**Status:** MAINNET LIVE — Audit Readiness Phase

---

## Executive Summary

Percolator is a permissionless perpetual futures protocol on Solana (devnet live; mainnet live).  
This threat model documents all identified security concerns, their severity, and their current status.

**Pre-mainnet blockers (Khubair action required):**
- 🔴 **CRITICAL: GH#1823** — Upgrade authority is single keypair. Transfer to Squads multisig.
- 🔴 **CRITICAL: GH#1876** — Supabase service_role key leaked in git history (7+ weeks). Rotate immediately.

**Remaining open issues:** LOW/INFO only. All CRITICAL/HIGH technical findings have been fixed.

## Open Security Issues (Pre-Mainnet)

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Khubair Action Required

| # | Issue | Status | Action |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **GH#1823: Upgrade authority single keypair** | OPEN | Khubair must create Squads multisig and transfer program authority. On-chain verified 2026-03-31: Authority 7JVQvrAf is System Program owner = plain keypair. Transfer has NOT happened. |
| 2 | **GH#1876: Supabase service_role key in git history** | OPEN | Khubair must rotate at Supabase dashboard. Key leaked 7+ weeks (since ~Feb 8). No upstream fix until rotation. |

### 🟡 LOW / INFORMATIONAL

| # | Issue | Severity | Component | Status |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 3 | GH#1946: SetOraclePriceCap negative bps | MEDIUM | percolator-prog | Anchor backlog (PERC backlog). Input validation gap on admin endpoint. No exploit without admin key compromise. |
| 4 | GH#1931: accrue_market_to silent failure not in CrankOutcome | LOW | percolator engine | PERC-8296 in progress. No fund risk. ADL coefficients stale for that crank if overflow, not updated. |
| 5 | GH#1915: InitSharedVault first-caller-wins | INFO | percolator-prog | Doc note in PR#158 (merged). Deployment procedure must create SharedVault before any attacker. |
| 6 | GH#1913: AdvanceEpoch doc inconsistency | INFO | percolator-prog | PERC-8314 anchor backlog. |
| 7 | VRAM parameter no upper bounds in UpdateRiskParams | LOW/INFO | percolator engine | Type constraints + downstream caps make all paths arithmetically safe. Admin trust boundary. Recommend defensive bounds. |
| 8 | Adaptive funding: no bounds on adaptive_max_funding_bps | LOW/INFO | percolator engine | i64 cast in compute caps value. No overflow. Admin trust boundary. Recommend cap ≤ 10_000 bps. |
| 9 | funding_p5 Kani proof covers dt < 1000 only | INFO | Kani proofs | 31_536_000 boundary guard is trivially correct but not formally proven. |
| 10 | execute_adl does not enforce target ordering | INFO/BY DESIGN | percolator engine | Caller can target any profitable position, not just rank #1. Off-chain keeper provides ordering. No fund risk. |
| 11 | freeze_funding / unfreeze_funding not exposed as instructions | INFO | percolator engine | No emergency rate stabilization capability. By design or gap — recommend documenting for auditors. |
| 12 | AuditCrank (tag 53) permissionless pause | LOW | percolator-prog | 150-slot cooldown mitigates DoS. Accepted risk. |
| 13 | Keeper #27/#28: wrong BTC mint in mainnet-markets.ts | LOW | percolator-keeper | Open. Market config issue. |

### ✅ CLOSED (Fixed This Session Cycle)

## ADL T14 Security Audit — COMPLETE ✅

**Scope:** ADL implementation T1–T8 + Kani proofs  
**Completed:** 2026-03-31 00:00 UTC  
**Result:** ALL CLEAN — no critical or high findings  

Coverage:

- **T2** (I256 PnL): ✅ — type migration correct, pnl_matured_pos_tot aggregate maintained
- **T3** (SideMode/InstructionContext): ✅ — enum repr safe, deferred reset triple-guarded
- **T4** (InstructionContext wiring): ✅ — TOCTOU-safe, fresh context per instruction
- **T5** (two-phase keeper): ✅ — epoch validation, stale count checked, insurance floor
- **T6–T8** (core ADL engine): ✅ — execute_adl arithmetic sound, conservation proven by Kani
- **Kani proofs**: ✅ — 12 proofs all sound (PR#174 + PR#70)
- **Oracle manipulation**: ✅ — ADL price cannot be manipulated for Pyth/Hyperp markets
- **Rank manipulation**: INFO — by-design permissive (any profitable target allowed); off-chain ordering

**T15 (QA regression):** UNBLOCKED as of 2026-03-31.

## VRAM Audit Results (Idle Audit 2026-03-31 00:00 UTC)

Reviewed all 4 VRAM parameters passed through UpdateRiskParams:

| Parameter | Type | Bounds Check | Downstream Safety |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| vol_margin_scale_bps | u16 (max 65535) | None | apply_vram_scaling caps final margin at 10,000 bps ✅ |
| vol_alpha_e6 | u16 (max 65535) | None | EWMA alpha ≤ 65535/1,000,000 < 1.0 — never > 1.0 ✅ |
| vol_margin_target_e6 | u16 | None | Zero-denominator guarded in compute_vram_margin_bps ✅ |
| adaptive_max_funding_bps | u64 | None | Clamped to i64 range in compute_adaptive_funding_rate ✅ |

**Verdict:** All VRAM parameters are safe via type constraints and downstream caps. No GH issues required. Informational note: consider adding defensive bounds (e.g. scale_bps ≤ 10,000, adaptive_max_funding_bps ≤ 10,000) in UpdateRiskParams handler as defense-in-depth against admin key compromise.

## Audit Signer/Auth Verification

All admin-gated instructions verified to use `expect_signer + require_admin`:
- SetRiskThreshold, UpdateAdmin, AcceptAdmin, SetOracleAuthority, SetOraclePriceCap, CloseSlab, UpdateConfig, SetMaintenanceFee, ResolveMarket, WithdrawInsurance, AdminForceClose, SetPendingSettlement, SetInsuranceWithdrawPolicy, SetWalletCap, AllocateMarket ✅

**ExecuteAdl verified admin-only:** `expect_signer(a_keeper) + require_admin(header.admin, a_keeper.key)` — NOT permissionless despite initial SDK JSDoc error (corrected in PR#49).

## Next Audit Rotation (CONTEXT.md reference)

Last idle audit completed: VRAM parameter bounds (2026-03-31 00:00 UTC)

Next rotation candidates:
1. SetOraclePriceCap negative bps (GH#1946 MEDIUM) — verify bounds in handler
2. compute_adaptive_funding_rate Kani gap — no proof covers this path
3. enqueue_adl (once T9+ code stabilizes for review)
