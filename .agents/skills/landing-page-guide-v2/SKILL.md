# Landing Page Guide V2

## Overview

This skill enables creation of **distinctive, high-converting landing pages** that combine:
- **Proven Conversion Framework**: 11 essential elements from DESIGNNAS for high conversion rates
- **Exceptional Design Quality**: Bold aesthetic choices that create unforgettable brand experiences
- **Production-Ready Code**: Next.js 14+ with ShadCN UI, TypeScript, and performance optimization

**Philosophy**: A landing page must convert visitors AND make them remember your brand. Generic, template-looking pages fail at both. This skill ensures your landing pages are functionally effective and visually extraordinary.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users request:
- Creation of landing pages, marketing pages, or product pages
- Next.js or React-based promotional websites
- Pages that need to convert visitors into customers AND stand out visually
- Professional marketing pages with exceptional design quality
- Landing pages that avoid generic "template" aesthetics
- Brand experiences that are both conversion-optimized and memorable

## Design Thinking: Before You Code

Before implementing any landing page, commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction** that aligns with the brand and product:

### 1. Understand Context
- **Purpose**: What problem does this product solve? Who is the target audience?
- **Brand Personality**: Is this brand playful, professional, luxury, minimalist, bold, technical?
- **Industry**: What visual language does this industry expect (or should we break)?
- **Differentiation**: What makes this brand unforgettable? What's the ONE thing visitors will remember?

### 2. Choose an Aesthetic Direction

Pick an extreme direction and commit fully. Examples:

**Minimalist & Refined**
- Brutally clean layouts, generous whitespace
- Sophisticated typography with large scale contrasts
- Monochromatic or limited color palette (2-3 colors max)
- Subtle micro-interactions, elegant transitions
- Examples: Luxury products, professional services, premium SaaS

**Bold & Maximalist**
- Rich, complex visual layers
- Dynamic animations and scroll effects
- Gradient meshes, textures, and overlapping elements
- Vibrant color palettes with high contrast
- Examples: Creative agencies, entertainment, youth brands

**Retro-Futuristic**
- Nostalgic elements with modern execution
- Geometric patterns, neon accents
- Glitch effects, scanlines, grain textures
- Monospace or display fonts with character
- Examples: Gaming, tech startups, creative tools

**Organic & Natural**
- Soft, flowing shapes and gradients
- Nature-inspired colors (earth tones, pastels)
- Smooth animations mimicking natural motion
- Rounded corners, soft shadows
- Examples: Wellness, sustainability, food

**Editorial & Magazine**
- Strong typographic hierarchy
- Grid-breaking asymmetric layouts
- Large, impactful imagery
- Bold use of whitespace and negative space
- Examples: Content platforms, media, education

**Brutalist & Raw**
- Unconventional layouts, intentional "ugly"
- System fonts or deliberately basic typography
- High contrast, limited color
- Minimal or no animations
- Examples: Art, fashion, anti-establishment brands

**CRITICAL**: Choose ONE clear direction. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is **intentionality**, not intensity. Execute your chosen direction with precision and consistency across all 11 elements.

### 3. Define Your Design System

Before coding, define these core decisions:

**Typography Choices**
- **Display Font**: Choose something distinctive and memorable (NOT Inter, Roboto, Arial, or system fonts)
  - Consider: Space Grotesk, Clash Display, Cabinet Grotesk, Syne, DM Serif Display, Zodiak, Fraunces, Archivo Black, Unbounded, Outfit
  - Or use Google Fonts wisely: Playfair Display, Crimson Pro, Libre Baskerville, Epilogue, Plus Jakarta Sans
  - **NEVER** converge on common choices - vary fonts across different projects
- **Body Font**: Refined, readable choice that complements display font
  - Consider: DM Sans, General Sans, Switzer, Geist, Manrope, Karla, Work Sans
- **Scale**: Establish clear hierarchy (e.g., H1: 4rem → H2: 3rem → H3: 2rem → Body: 1rem)

**Color Palette**
- **Dominant Color**: Your primary brand color (60% usage)
- **Accent Color**: High-contrast color for CTAs (10% usage)
- **Neutral Palette**: Grays or earth tones (30% usage)
- **Background Strategy**: Solid, gradient, texture, or pattern?
- Define as CSS variables for consistency

**Motion Strategy**
- **Page Load**: Staggered reveals with animation-delay for hero elements
  - Hero title words fade in sequentially (animation-delay: 0ms, 100ms, 200ms)
  - Subtitle follows (delay: 300ms)
  - CTA appears last (delay: 500ms) with emphasis
- **Scroll Interactions**: Fade-ups, parallax, or scroll-triggered animations?
- **Hover States**: Subtle scale, color shift, or dramatic transformations?
- **CTA Animations**: How do buttons attract attention without being annoying?

**Spatial Approach**
- **Layout Style**: Centered and symmetric? Asymmetric and dynamic? Grid-breaking?
- **Spacing System**: Tight and dense? Generous and airy?
- **Section Flow**: Traditional stacked? Diagonal? Overlapping?

## The 11 Essential Elements Framework

For detailed explanations of each element, refer to `references/11-essential-elements.md`.

## Design Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography Excellence
- **NEVER** use generic fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Helvetica, system-ui
- **Display fonts** should be distinctive and memorable
- **Pair wisely**: Display font for headings + refined body font for text
- **Scale dramatically**: Create clear hierarchy with size jumps (not subtle differences)
- **Letter spacing**: Adjust for display fonts (often needs tighter tracking)
- **Line height**: Display = 1.1-1.2, Body = 1.6-1.8

### Color & Visual Coherence
- **Define CSS variables** for all colors (maintain consistency)
- **Dominant color** should appear throughout (not just CTAs)
- **Accent colors** must have sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)
- **Avoid**: Purple gradients on white (overused AI aesthetic)
- **Backgrounds**: Create atmosphere with gradients, meshes, patterns, or textures
  - Gradient meshes: Multi-color smooth gradients
  - Noise textures: Subtle grain for depth
  - Geometric patterns: Dots, lines, or shapes at low opacity
  - Layered transparencies: Overlapping colored sections

### Motion & Animation
- **Page load**: One well-orchestrated entrance with staggered reveals
  - Hero title words fade in sequentially (animation-delay: 0ms, 100ms, 200ms)
  - Subtitle follows (delay: 300ms)
  - CTA appears last (delay: 500ms) with emphasis
- **Scroll animations**: Sections fade up as they enter viewport
  - Use Intersection Observer API or Framer Motion's scroll triggers
  - Cards stagger in
